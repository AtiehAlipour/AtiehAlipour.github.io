    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p >I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. 
      I completed my M.S. and Ph.D. in the Center for Complex Hydrosystems Research (CCHR) and the Department of Civil, 
      Construction, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Alabama. My research focuses on enhancing
       climate risk estimation by improving our understanding of different components of the risk i.e., hazard,
        vulnerability, and exposure. I address this question by performing research that integrates a wide
         range of disciplines such as engineering, Earth sciences, data science, and statistics.  
      For past research projects, I have performed a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal 
      characteristics of floods over the southeast US, designed an innovative framework for flash 
      flood damage prediction across the Southeast US, conducted a global sensitivity analysis of a
       hydrodynamic model simulating extensive flooding induced by Hurricane Harvey, and later proposed 
       a new multivariate hazard index for improving tropical cyclone hazard communication. <br>
       <br> I am currently working with Prof. Klaus Keller to study the uncertainty associated
        with soil moisture estimation and resulting yield prediction using the Water Balance Model (WBM). 
       <br><br>Outside of work, I enjoy watching movies, traveling, and generally spending time outdoors.
